This the code for COSC3P95 A1 Q2
Markers may use vscode to run the BubbleSort.cpp on the vscode terminal.
The output.txt is a exampel to show how the program presents results and this example I just set the length of array equals to 3 to make it easy to get results.
And makers can set it to random by using eting  //int length =1+std::rand()%100; and removing // before using
Here are instructions
1. peopel may input an int to indicate how many tests they want to run
2. input the expected arrays by enter related elements
3. people will see results
